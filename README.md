# mooderation
## twitch moderation tool completely static html and json files (client side requests only!)
## Currently working on more API usage, locally working well but I need to make it more flexible (so you can use it for your own streams)
![(work in progress)](https://github.com/moo-the-cow/mooderation/blob/master/changelog.md)

### Intention of that tool
This will be a moderation tool only. Why not use the twitch native moderation tool? Because it is missing some quite useful stuff that I've implemented in here:

Worth mentioning:
+ Whispering to ALL moderators that are currently online in the channel (because you do private conversations - that's a missing feature for years on twitch side)
https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/923380-moderation-tools/suggestions/17475625--modchat
+ Mass ban/timeouts (deactivated)
+ Filtering chat (twitch can only filter users)
+ Using external user ban lists
+ Using external user bad word lists
+ Exporting Chatlogs into CSV files


This project will grow and probably some more features will be added over time

like https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310213-developers/suggestions/40616518-delete-clips **Deleting (bad) Clips** but it has not been implemented by twitch yet! (so maybe you can upvote it)
